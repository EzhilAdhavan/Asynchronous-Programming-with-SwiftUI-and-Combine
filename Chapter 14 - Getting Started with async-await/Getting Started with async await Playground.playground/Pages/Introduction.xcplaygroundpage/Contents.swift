 # Getting Started with async/await
 Created by [Peter Friese](https://twitter.com/peterfriese) â€“ [peterfriese.dev](https://peterfriese.dev)
 
 In this Swift Playground, you will learn several ways to write asynchronous code in Swift.
 
 - note: Due to limitations in the current version of the Swift Playgrounds app for macOS, some of the code in this playground will fail to compile. Please open the playground in Xcode 14 on your Mac instead to run the code.
 
 This Swift Playground accompanies _Asynchronous Programming with SwiftUI and Combine_ by Peter Friese. For the best learning experience, it is recommended to follow the samples in this playground while reading chapter 14 - _Getting Started with async/await_.
