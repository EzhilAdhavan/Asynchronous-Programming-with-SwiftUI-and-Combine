 # Getting Started with async/await
 Created by [Peter Friese](https://twitter.com/peterfriese) â€“ [peterfriese.dev](https://peterfriese.dev)
 
 In this Swift Playground, you will learn several ways to write asynchronous code in Swift.
 
 - note: You can open and run the playground in Xcode on your Mac, but you will have a better experience when opening and running it in the Swift Playground app ([download](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1496833156) it fromn the Mac App Store).
 
 This playground accompanies _Asynchronous Programming with SwiftUI and Combine_ by Peter Friese. For the best learning experience, it is recommended to follow the samples in this playground while reading chapter 14 - _Getting Started with async/await_.
